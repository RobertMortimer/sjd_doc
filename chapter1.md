# Week 1 : An introduction to Python

## Getting Started

### Introduction

During this course we will be using free resources to learn python. Along with the task of learning the language we will also cover the wider subject of what it is to be a developer. For the simple smantics of the language we will be using codecademy. Codecademy is great as a learning resource for the language but it is no good for attempting to write your own programs that you can use localy. For developiing localy we will be installing a developer toolchain including:

* The python runtime
* An IDE
* Relevant IDE plugins
* Testing framework
* Source control

Throughout we will be using open source software

### Gmail : Authentication to bind them all

To log on to services such as Codecademy \(learning platform\) and Github \(source control\) it is handy to have a common source of authentication. For this we will be using Gmail. If you do not already have a gmail account get one for free.
