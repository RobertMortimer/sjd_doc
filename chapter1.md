# Week 1 : An introduction to Python

## Getting Started

### Introduction

During this course we will be using free resources to learn python. Along with the task of learning the language we will also cover the wider subject of what it is to be a developer. For the simple semantics of the language we will be using codecademy. Codecademy is great as a learning resource for the language but it is no good for attempting to write your own programs that you can use locally. For developing locally we will be installing a developer tool-chain including:

* The python runtime
* An IDE
* Relevant IDE plugins
* Testing framework
* Source control

Throughout we will be using open source software

### Gmail

To log on to services such as Codecademy \(learning platform\) and Github \(source control\) it is handy to have a common source of authentication. For this we will be using Gmail. If you do not already have a Gmail account get one for free.

### Python

For this course we will be using python 3.7.x. Python 3.7 is at time of writing the most up-to-date stable python development branch. Python can be downloaded from here:

[https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)

This is the home of the reference C python \(python implementation written in C\).

Other implementations exist in other languages such as Java and .net

:exclamation: Install it somewhere easy like c:\python37

### WinGit

WinGit is the main windows implementation of the Git source control system originally started by Linus Torvalds \(leader of the Linux kernel project\). Visual studio rests on WinGit for it's source control functions and as a result it is cleaner to install it before Visual Studio.

### Visual Studio

Visual studio is an open-source IDE written by microsoft provide and entry point to programming in the Microsoft ecosystem that could compete with other open source IDEs such and Atom and Eclipse. It can be found here.

Once installed you need to add at least the Microsoft Python plug-ins. See below for a Microsoft article on getting set up

### Testing

We will be using the unit test module supplied with Python

### Source code repository

For our source code repository we will be using github. Github is a free resource for open source programmers. It is used for collaboration on software projects.

## Setting it all up

There is an excellent guide to setting it all up to work together here:

## Learning resources

### Learning environment

To learn the basics of the Python programming language we will be using the Codecademy website

[https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)

This provides an excellent resource for learning the fundamentals of python in small snippets but does not cover the issues of writing and running programs on your local machine. You can log onto Codecademy using your google account for authentication.

### A Byte of python

Although Codecademy give a nice structured introduction to python it does not cover the wider skills of creating and running and maintaining your own python programs. A Byte of python will be our road-map towards becoming competent local developer.

### Learning Git

git is the source code management tool we will be using. Even for a single user git is invaluable as ti allows you to jot down your thoughts as you program as well as allowing you to try different approaches to a problem with the safety net of being able to roll back.

Whatever you code with Git is awesome
